Explanation of Work seen in R Project Module 8 Document

First loaded the 'mtcars' dataset from R's built-in datasets. Then created a subset containing only 'qsec', 'wt', 'carb', and 'disp' variables. Built a linear model using 'qsec' as the dependent variable and 'wt', 'carb', 'disp' as predictors. Summarized the model to check the significance and coefficients of the predictors. Prepared new data for prediction with the specified 'wt', 'carb', and 'disp' values.Then used the 'predict' function to estimate 'qsec' for the new data.
The initial multiple linear regression model was built using qsec as the dependent variable and hp, wt, cyl, carb, and disp as predictors.
summary(initial_model) provides the coefficients, standard errors, t-values, and p-values for each predictor, along with overall model statistics such as R-squared and F-statistic.
The refined model was built using qsec as the dependent variable and only wt, carb, and disp as predictors

Interpretation of Results:

Initial Model
Coefficients: These indicate the change in the dependent variable (qsec) for a one-unit change in the predictor, holding all other predictors constant.
p-values: These indicate each predictor is statistically significant. Typically, a p-value less than 0.05 is considered significant and the p-value is 1.449e-08
Significant Predictors: Based on the p-values, we identified the significant predictors (wt, carb, and disp) for building the refined model.

Refined model
Coefficients:
Intercept: The expected value of qsec when all predictors are zero = 16.89
wt: The effect of a one-unit increases in weight on the quarter-mile time (qsec). A positive coefficient means that as weight increases, the qsec value increases, indicating a slower acceleration.
carb: The effect of a one-unit increases in the number of carburettors on qsec. A positive coefficient suggests that more carburettors are associated with a slower quarter-mile time.
disp: The effect of a one-unit increases in displacement on qsec. A positive coefficient suggests that higher displacement is associated with a slower quarter-mile time.
p-values: the p-value is equal to 1.905e-09 making it statistically significant. 

New Data Predictions
These predictions indicate the expected quarter-mile times for vehicles with the specified combinations of weight, number of carburettors, and displacement.
For instance, increasing weight generally results in an increase in qsec, indicating slower acceleration. Similarly, increasing the number of carburettors and displacement also results in higher qsec values, meaning slower acceleration.

The addition of creating new data predictions helped define the expected results of the regression models. The stepwise motion of moving from a simple model to more complex and then predicting new data made understanding the mechanisms of the statistics simpler.
